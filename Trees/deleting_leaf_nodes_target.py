'''
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).

 

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed (Picture in left). 
After removing, new nodes become leaf nodes with value (target = 2) (Picture in center).
Example 2:
Input: root = [1,3,3,3,2], target = 3
Output: [1,3,null,null,2]
Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2,null,2,null,2], target = 2
Output: [1]
Explanation: Leaf nodes in green with value (target = 2) are removed at each step.
Example 4:

Input: root = [1,1,1], target = 1
Output: []
Example 5:

Input: root = [1,2,3], target = 1
Output: [1,2,3]
